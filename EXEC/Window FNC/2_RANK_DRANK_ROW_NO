-- RANK
-- The RANK() function in SQL is a window function that assigns a unique rank to each row within a partition of a result set. 
-- Rows with equal values receive the same rank, but the next rank(s) will be skipped, resulting in gaps. 

select * , RANK() OVER(order BY marks desc)
from marks;

select * , RANK() OVER(partition by branch order BY marks desc)
from marks;

-- DENSE RANK
select * , RANK() OVER(partition by branch order BY marks desc) , DENSE_RANK() OVER(partition by branch order BY marks desc)
from marks;

-- ROW NUMBER
select * , ROW_NUMBER() OVER() , ROW_NUMBER() OVER(partition by branch)
from marks;

-- row number with concat
select * ,
concat(branch , ' - ' , ROW_NUMBER() OVER(partition by branch))
from marks;
