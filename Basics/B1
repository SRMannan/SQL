-- Deleting customers where salary is 5000
DELETE FROM customer WHERE salary = 5000;

-- SQL ALTER TABLE
-- Adding a date of birth (dob) column to the existing customer table
ALTER TABLE customer ADD dob DATE;

-- Modifying the dob column to a year data type (not recommended for existing date data)
-- Note: Changing DATE to YEAR may not be supported in some DBMS, and could lead to data loss if the column already contains DATE data.
ALTER TABLE customer MODIFY dob YEAR;

-- Describe the table schema to see the final structure
DESC customer;

-- Selecting all records from the customer table to see the final state
SELECT * FROM customer;

-- SQL DROP COLUMN
-- Dropping the dob column from the existing customer table
ALTER TABLE customer DROP dob;

-- Selecting all records from the customer table to see the final state after dropping the column
SELECT * FROM customer;
